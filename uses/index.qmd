I often discuss with the curious ones about my research workflow and the different tools I use. I tried to describe in a more detailed list of all the interconnected programs I use.

I try to keep this updated fairly regularly. As of January 17, 2025 this is what I’m using:

## Development

### Science and research

-   I post almost everything I write or develop on [GitHub](https://github.com/kulbhushanchand).

### Web

-   I build my website using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
-   I use firefox dediactely with enough extensions for my need for all by web browsing tasks.
