    "title": "Impact of Indian Classical Raga in Immersive Environments on Human Psycho-physiological Parameters",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background: Indian classical music is categorized structurally and combinational and may benefit mental health. However, the psychological and physiological consequences of auditory stimuli like the Indian Classical ragas (a type of music) are less well known. Aim & Objective: To address the literature gap, this study aims to find the relaxation effects of classical Raga (Raga Bhairavi) in an immersive environment. Method: A within-group design study was performed with 22 participants following three interventions in the following order: Relaxed-baseline (paced breathing), Stress-baseline (using a mental arithmetic exam), and VR Raga (listening to classical music in an immersive environment). On the first day, all three interventions were delivered in order, while for the next six days, the Raga intervention was delivered only in virtual reality (VR) simulation. The participant’s heart rate variability (HRV) was recorded during the intervention on the first and sixth days. Also, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) questionnaire was executed at the study’s start (first day) and end (sixth day), respectively. Result: After six days of VR-based Raga intervention, the participants showed a significant reduction in the DASS-21 scores for stress, anxiety, and depression and significant improvement in the RR triangular index and reduction in the respiratory rate. We discuss how Raga interventions in VR could provide a conducive method for managing stress, anxiety, and depression."

The primary aim of this chapter is to devise and develop means to enhance tourism and provide culturally important knowledge to people. Moreover, internet is booming, and the number of smartphones is increasing day by day. The same is happening in many developing countries. Therefore, in this chapter, the authors propose a criterion that uses technology to promote historical significance and enhances tourism industry as well. The proposed app uses the concept of gamification that acts as a platform to fuel the process of branding in a manner that engages the tourists and provide them with an experience that can make them feel more connected to the tourism destinations."

    "text": "Research and development are important for the sustenance of any modern economy. Hence, in any society it is important to have a strong supply of scientists and engineers. From an Indian context, it is observed, however, that very few engineers choose to pursue research as their primary domain of interest. This chapter tries to identify from an institutional perspective on why engineers repeatedly shun their core branch subjects to pursue something else. The study highlights the mental framework of an engineering student and how the environment can be molded to invoke the interest of the student towards research and development. A gamified approach to solving this problem is proposed. The entire problem is fit into a gamification framework called Octalysis to identify the core motivators for engaging students in research. Finally, the chapter proposes reforms that can be adopted in order to create a holistic environment where students can participate freely and engage positively in cutting-edge projects."

    "text": "Abstract\nAfDaq is an open-source, plug-and-play, MATLAB-based tool that offers the capabilities of multichannel real-time data acquisition, visualization, manipulation, and local saving of data for offline analysis. The MATLAB Arduino package suffers from serious timing jitter during real-time data acquisition. This timing jitter associated with four main commands (analog read, digital read, digital write, and PWM set) available in MATLAB Arduino package is statistically analyzed, and a simple post-hoc timing jitter correction mechanism is proposed to acquire data points with high timing accuracy. The benchmark of the final program is conducted at various sampling rates for multichannel acquisition with 10 Hz comes as the maximum sampling rate for 5 channel recording. In the end, a use case of the developed tool for physiological data acquisition in multimodal biofeedback is presented. The software tool, data, and analysis scripts that support the findings of this study are released as an open-source project to support the replicability and reproducibility of the research."

    "text": "Abstract\nVideo games are used to increase the engagement of biofeedback systems. For cost-effectiveness, the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games can be used. Therefore, a multimodal biofeedback system was developed to leverage the NES games for biofeedback. This study aims to test the efficacy of the developed system, the motivation of participants, and the usability of the system. A within-group design study was conducted with 16 participants followed through four interventions: deep breathing, stress-test, non-biofeedback game (control), and biofeedback game (experiment), where their HRV was recorded. Participants showed significantly different HRV during interventions (F(1.60, 23.93) = 11.94, p &lt; 0.001) and reported higher HRV when using biofeedback game than the non-biofeedback game (t(15) = 9.14, p &lt; 0.0001). The motivation was reported to be the same with biofeedback and non-biofeedback version of the game, and the overall system was reported as usable. The results of this study support the efficacy of using original NES games in biofeedback for mental relaxation."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a crucial metric that provides valuable insight into the balance between relaxation and stress. Previous research has shown that most HRV parameters improve during periods of mental relaxation, while decreasing during tasks involving cognitive workload. Although a comprehensive analysis of both linear and non-linear HRV parameters has been carried out in existing literature, there still exists a need for further research in this area. Additionally, limited knowledge exists regarding how specific interventions may influence the interpretation of these parameters and how the different parameters correlate under different interventions. This study aims to address these gaps by conducting a thorough comparison of different linear and non-linear HRV parameters under mentally relaxed versus stressful states.\nMethodology: Participants were randomly and equally divided among two between-subjects groups: relaxed-stress (RS) (N = 22) and stress-relaxed (SR) (N = 22). In the RS group, a paced breathing task was given for 5 min to create relaxation, and was followed by a 5-min time-based mental calculation task to create stress. In the SR group, the order of the stress and relaxed tasks was reversed. There was a washout period of 15 min after the first task in both groups.\nResults: Of the 37 HRV parameters, 33 differed significantly between the two interventions. The majority of the parameters exhibited an improving and degrading tendency of HRV parameters in the relaxed and stressed states, respectively. The correlation of the majority of HRV parameters decreases during stress, while prominent time domain and geometric domain parameters stand out in the correlation.\nConclusion: Overall, HRV parameters can be reliably used to assess a person’s relaxed and stressed mental states during paced breathing and mental arithmetic task respectively. Furthermore, non-linear HRV parameters provide accurate estimators of the mental state, in addition to the commonly used linear parameters."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe effects of classical music on psychophysiological parameters are not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of listening to raga Bhairavi, an Indian Classical Music for six days on anxiety, stress, depression, and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Forty-four individuals were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (VR-raga), where they listened to raga Bhairavi via 360° video in a virtual reality environment, or the control group, where there was no exposure to raga Bhairavi for six days. Before allocation, the HRV baselines (relax-baseline and stress-baseline) were recorded on the first day. On the first and sixth days of the intervention, HRV was monitored, and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) questionnaire was administered before and after the intervention. After six days, all DASS-21 subscales were significantly reduced in the VR-raga group. A similar trend was observed in the seven HRV parameters evaluated in this study, which demonstrated reduced physiological stress and enhanced autonomic balance following the six-day intervention. The findings collectively indicated the efficacy of the VR-based raga Bhairavi intervention in reducing psychological stress markers and highlighted the potential applications of utilizing the VR-based raga intervention for improving mental well-being in the real-world context."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn the traditional biofeedback system, videogames are effectively used to increase engagement as a feedback delivery mechanism via changing in-game mechanics. The original 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games make them an excellent choice for biofeedback for their popularity and simple gameplay mechanics. For this, we present BioNES, which is a MATLAB-based GUI tool to leverage the NES games for multimodal biofeedback. The RR beats can be received from any Arduino compatible board to compute the heart rate variability (HRV). The deviation of HRV from baseline corresponds to the mental stress of the player and is used to compute feedback which is then delivered via NES game running in FCEUX emulator. The player can then use any relaxation protocol, like paced breathing to learn stress management during gameplay. The system performance and efficacy via randomized controlled trials have been proved in the separate open data research. The BioNES is meant to be a simple plug-and-play and affordable biofeedback solution for researchers without programming experience and casual users to use video games for health."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The recent studies show that the children with learning disabilities numbers have been gradually increased in India. Though the main reason for the cause of this disorder is unknown, the authors strongly believe that this neurological disorder is explained as a genetic disorder passed from elder hierarchy to the next generation. With the available resources, the awareness programs are limited to urban areas only on account of using current technology in diagnosing disorders. In developed countries, it is seen that new technologies taking birth every day for the treatment of these disorders. This includes LCD 3D display, Kinect games, computer games (psychotherapeutic) in therapy sessions, etc. These kinds of games make children more attentive towards the intervention bringing new changes in the day-to-day lives of the children. In this chapter, a new algorithm has been highlighted for the intervention of children with dyslexia by using the Android application as a source to increase the level of perception and sound-symbol association of the respective alphabets used and studied."

    "title": "Prediction of decision-making performance post-longitudinal tDCS administration via EEG features and machine learning",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Prior research shows that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has the propensity to induce performance gains in human subjects in various cognitive processes. However, very little is known about whether these gains can be predicted via machine learning data using Electroencephalography (EEG) data. To address this gap, in this study, feature-selection approaches and machine learning (ML) are performed on various features extracted from EEG data to predict human performance gains due to tDCS administration. Human data was collected from two distinct groups of people (tDCS (N = 15) and sham (N = 15)), one of which undertook tDCS administration over six days (sham did not undertake the tDCS administration). On day 1 and day 8, data was collected on the user’s performance in an underwater search-and-shoot simulation. 32-channel EEG data was acquired during task execution. Different feature-selection and regression-based machine learning techniques were attempted to predict the change in performance on day 8 compared to day 1. Results revealed that univariate feature selection performed best with random forest regression with an 8% error among different feature selection techniques. We highlight the inferences of our results for performance gain prediction from tDCS and allied interventions."
