As of December 20, 2024, I'm spending all my time on these things:

-   Staying in the Himalayas and working as a Post Doctoral fellow in the [IIT Mandi iHub and HCI Foundation](https://www.ihubiitmandi.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Mandi](https://www.iitmandi.ac.in/)
- Most of the time residing in the [Center for Human Computer Interaction](https://chci.iitmandi.ac.in/) lab for research work.
- Working in few large projects involving the use of technologies for mental health.
- Developing Proof of Concepts (mostly wearables and affordable healthcare devices) for the translation research.
- Writing and submitting manuscripts for the publication.
