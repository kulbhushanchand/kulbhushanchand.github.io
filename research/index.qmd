My research spans Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS), biofeedback systems, and healthcare technologies. I study mental wellness and stress regulation, focusing on HRV biofeedback and the effects of Indian classical music, such as ragas, on emotional well-being. My work emphasizes integrating IKS principles to enhance user engagement and therapeutic outcomes. I also focus on developing affordable biofeedback systems to make mental wellness technologies more accessible. {{< ai blank-just-to-add-ai-dependency-to-this-page >}}
